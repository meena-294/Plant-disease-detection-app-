# Android Project Setup and Run Instructions

## 1. Download the Project Code
Go to the repository link: **https://github.com/meena-294/Plant-disease-detection-app-.git**
Click the **'Code'** button and then select **'Download ZIP'**.

## 2. Extract Files
Locate the downloaded **ZIP file** (e.g., `Plant-disease-detection-app--main.zip`) and **extract** its contents to a local folder.

## 3. Import into Android Studio
1.  Open **Android Studio**.
2.  On the welcome screen, choose **'Open'** or go to **File > Open**.
3.  Navigate to the folder where you extracted the project (the one containing the `app` folder and `build.gradle` file) and select it. Click **OK** or **Open**.

## 4. Sync Gradle
1.  Once the project is loaded, Android Studio will likely prompt you to sync the project.
2.  If it doesn't prompt automatically, look for the **'Sync Project with Gradle Files'** icon (it looks like an elephant with a downward arrow or an icon with two circular arrows) in the toolbar (usually near the top right).
3.  **Click this sync option** to download dependencies and sync the project files. Wait for the sync process to complete (the status will be shown in the bottom bar).

## 5. Prepare Your Android Device (for USB Debugging)
### a. Enable Developer Options
1.  Go to your phone's **Settings**.
2.  Scroll down and tap **'About Phone'** (or **'System' > 'About Phone'**).
3.  Tap on **'Build number'** rapidly (usually 7 times) until a message appears saying **"You are now a developer!"** or **"Developer options have been enabled."**

### b. Enable USB Debugging
1.  Go back to **Settings** and find **'System'** or **'Additional Settings'**.
2.  Tap on **'Developer options'**.
3.  Scroll down and **enable the toggle** for **'USB debugging'**.
4.  Connect your phone to your computer using a USB cable. If prompted on the phone, allow the connection and accept the **'Allow USB debugging?'** prompt.

## 6. Run the Application
1.  In Android Studio, look at the **toolbar at the top**.
2.  Ensure your **connected device** is selected in the device selection dropdown (next to the run button).
3.  Click the **'Run'** button (it looks like a green, filled triangle, often centered in the top toolbar).
4.  Android Studio will build the app and install/run it on your connected device.
